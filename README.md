## Wi-Fi Scanner

Because sometimes you need to know if your neighbor's "FBI Surveillance Van" network is real or just very committed to the bit.

A real-time Wi-Fi network scanner with a web interface that shows you every network your device can see. Updates every 10 seconds so you can watch your signal strength deteriorate as you walk to the basement.

**What it does:**
- Scans for nearby Wi-Fi networks
- Shows signal strength (so you know who to blame for slow internet)
- Displays security types (WPA2, WPA3, or "please hack me")
- Auto-refreshes because manually clicking refresh is so 2010
- Runs on a simple Python server (no bloated frameworks)

**Perfect for:**
- Finding the best spot for your router
- Seeing how many networks named "Pretty fly for a wifi" exist
- Network troubleshooting
- Raspberry Pi projects

**Tech**: Python, nmcli, vanilla JS
